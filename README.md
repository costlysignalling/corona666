# Corona virus and the number of the beasts
Yesterday, a facebook friend shared a post about letters in the word CORONA adding up to 66, which was supposted to be interesting since together with the letter count (6 letters) we get the "number of the beast".

I was wondering how many words have this property.
I analyzed a dataset of 370104 english words adapted from https://github.com/dwyl/english-words and found out that there is 695 words, (0.19 %  of all words, 2.32 % of 6-letter words). Among 6-letter words, however, the sum 66 was the fourth most frequent (only 71, 70, and 65 topped 66). The 666 words and not unusual, really.

*My favourites* (in alphabetical order):
 
  "anubis" (I am not even surprised this turned out to be a 666 word)
  "bootie"
  "empire" 
  "monads" (I like Leibniz)
  "nomads" (And Deleuze)
  "pigeon"
  "pyjama" (This should have been pointed out with the original post!)
  "trader" (see empire)
  "trifid"
  "weewee" (I am sorry to add "bootie" and "weewee", I am just that kind of person...)

You can browse them all in the "beasts.txt" file.
Have fun!
